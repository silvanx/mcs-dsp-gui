 *    Usage:  lnk6x <obj files...>    -o <out file> -m <map file> lnk.cmd

 *    Description: This file is a sample linker command file that can be    
 *                 used for linking programs built with the C compiler and  
 *                 running the resulting .out file on a C620x/C670x         
 *                 simulator.  Use it as a guideline.  You will want to     
 *                 change the memory layout to match your specific C6xxx    
 *                 target system.  You may want to change the allocation    
 *                 scheme according to the size of your program.            
 *                                                                          
 *    Notes: (1)   You must specivy a directory in which rts6x00.lib is     
 *                 located.  either add a -i"<directory>" line to this      
 *                 file or use the system environment variable C_DIR to     
 *                 specify a search path for the libraries.                 
 *                                                                          
 *           (2)   If the run-time library you are using is not named       
 *                 rts6200[e].lib, rts6400[e].lib, or rts6700[e].lib, be    
 *                 sure to use the correct name here.                       
 *
